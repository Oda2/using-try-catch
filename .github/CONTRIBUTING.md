Thank you for contributing using-try-catch
=====================================================

If you're reading this, you're awesome! Thank you for helping us make this project great and being.
Here are a few guidelines that will help you along the way.

## You first Pull Request

Working on your first Pull request?

If you decide to fix and issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is 
already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating
that you have started to work on it so other people dont't accidentally duplicate your effort.

## Sending a Pull Request

using-try-catch is a community project, so pull requests are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers.

When in doubt, keep your pull requests small. To give a PR the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per pull request. It's always best to create two smaller PRs than one big one.

When adding new features or modifying existing code, please attempt to include tests to confirm the new behaviour.
